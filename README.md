# Project: Country IQ level Analysis

**Executive Summary**

This project uses python to analyze to determine if factors such as higher income or increased education expenditure would cause higher IQ scores. The hypothisis is, higher education and/or higher income indicate higher IQ scores.

**Peliminary findings:**

In reviewing the averge income to IQ we note the lowest scores are where average income is less then 20k. Further observation shows the higher scores are in the 40-70k range. Income higher then than this does not produce highter IQ scores. **Thus the finding in comparrison is some income does increase the IQ score, however there is a diminishing return once income increases outside of the normal distribution or bell shape of the sample range.**

A comparrison of the education expenditure to IQ shows similar results. Low education expenditure is consistent with low IQ scores. higher expenditure in the 1500 to 4000 range produces the highest scores. The highest expenditure produces the same diminishing returns where more resources does not contribute to higher scores.
